### Contributing A Patch

If you're working on an existing issue, such as one of the `help-wanted` ones
above, simply respond to the issue and express interest in working on it.  This
helps other people know that the issue is active, and hopefully prevents
duplicated efforts.

If you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
1. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
1. If your proposed change is accepted, fork the repo, develop, and test your changes.
1. Submit a pull request.

If you want to work on a bigger idea, submit an issue describing your proposed design.

### Adding dependencies

If your patch depends on new packages, add that package with
[`godep`](https://github.com/tools/godep).  Follow the [instructions to add a
dependency](docs/devel/development.md#godep-and-dependency-management).
